# Handwritten Digit Recognition from-scratch
## Computational Intelligence course project

In this project a simple `neural network` is implemented in 2 different ways (`MNIST` Dataset is used for training and testing):
> 1. Without vectorization
> 2. With vectorization

At the end an Adversarial attack has taken place on images (shifting the images).
`SGD with momentum` is implemented as well.
